**Note: To collect static files from the root rather than blueprint directories, make sure you create and place the static files in `static` directory**

### Logging
Duck logs everything to both the console and files (in assets/.logs directory). You can customize logging configuration in settings.py.
 

### Running the Server

To start the Duck server, navigate to your project directory and run:
```sh
python main.py # or duck runserver --file main.py
```

*Alternatively, use:*
```sh
cd myproject  
duck runserver -p 8000 -d 'localhost' # The -d flag resolves to the server domain.
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 or https://localhost:8000 if **ENABLE_HTTPS** is enabled in **settings.py**.

**Note**: Running the app from the terminal ignores **main.py** unless explicityly specified using **--file** argument.

You can use **--ipv6** argument to start server on ipv6 address.

*Once you open your browser at the respective url, you should see something like this.*

### What Your Terminal Looks Like After Running `duck runserver`

After running the `duck runserver` command, your terminal should display output similar to the examples below:

**For Smaller Screens:**
![Duck local website terminal](./images/duck-local-site-small-terminal.jpg)

**For Larger Screens:**

## Example Application Files

```py
# main.py

from duck.app import App  

app = App(port=8000, addr='127.0.0.1') # App(port=8000, addr='::1', uses_ipv6=True) for ipv6

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()
```

```py
# views.py

def home():  
    return "<h1>Hello world</h1>" # or a duck.http.HttpResponse object.
```

```py
# urls.py

from duck.urls import path, re_path
from . import views  

urlpatterns = [  
    path("/", views.home, "home", methods=["GET"]), # methods is optional
]

```

## Django Integration 🐍  
Duck has seamless Django integration which enables more control and customization of the web development process. You can use Django and Duck interchangeably within the same project.  

While Duck does not currently support database models, which would enable data migration, etc., **Django ORM** is a good option to use. This means you can define `urlpatterns` that rely on databases, which will be handled by the Django backend, while lightweight routes can be managed by Duck—more likely used as a CDN.

Alternatively, if you want to access Django ORM without defining separate `urlpatterns` (on both the Duck and Django sides), you can convert a Duck request to a Django request using:  
duck.backend.django.utils.duck_to_django_request  
duck.backend.django.django_to_duck_request  
or vice-versa. The `duck.backend.django.utils` module provides more functions that help facilitate the interaction between Duck and Django. Keep in mind that using these tools may ensure only essential fields are transferred, but not all attributes from one request/response object may be preserved.

Feel free to use an alternate ORM, as Duck is not limited to Django's ORM.

### Getting Started with Django 🚀  
To enable Django, set `USE_DJANGO = True` in your `settings.py` file. Once this is done, all HTTP traffic will be forwarded to the Django server, even for `urlpatterns` defined in Duck. This behavior can be stopped by setting `DUCK_EXPLICIT_URLS` in `settings.py`.  

`DUCK_EXPLICIT_URLS` is a list of regex URLs that you want Duck to handle directly, instead of passing them to Django (e.g., Django admin site). You can also specify URLs for Django to handle strictly by setting `DJANGO_SIDE_URLS`. These settings are clearly documented in `settings.py`.

You can leverage Duck and Django interchangeably for various use cases, like using Duck as a CDN or for handling APIs.  

---

### Security in Django Integration 🔒  
**Duck** prioritizes security when integrating with **Django**. The Django server is protected by ensuring that only Duck can communicate with it.
If you try to access the **Django** server directly after it has been set up by Duck, the request will be automatically rejected. Duck configures Django to accept requests only from hosts that both Duck and Django know.

By using **Django** as the backend, an additional layer of security is introduced. New requests must pass through both Duck and Django middleware, adding an extra level of protection before reaching the core application.
This layered security approach helps ensure that each request is thoroughly validated, enhancing the overall safety of your application. 🔐

Duck modifies the following headers before sending the request to the Django server:  
```
Host  
Origin (if present)
Referer (if present)
```

### How can I obtain the headers modified by Duck in their original state? 🤔  
Don't worry—Duck provides a solution!  
When these headers are modified, the original headers will be set with a `D-` prefix. You can easily retrieve the real header by doing this:
```py
header = headers.get("D-Some-Header")
```

*You can also use Duck template tags and filters, which might not be built into Django's template engine, by using the following:*
```django
{% load ducktags %}
```

**See the Duck full project documentation for more Django customization options.**


## 📘 Blueprints

Organize routes/urlpatterns using blueprints for better management. Blueprints let you group URL patterns under a single namespace.

**Note**: Blueprint names determine the route prefix.
For example, a route `/home` under a blueprint named products becomes `/products/home`. This behavior may be disabled by parsing set argument `prepend_name_to_url` to False.

**You can create multiple blueprints under same blueprint.py file.**

### 🗺️ Blueprint Structure Example

```
myproject/  
├── some_name/  
│   ├── blueprint.py  
│   └── views.py  
├── main.py  
├── settings.py  
├── urls.py  
└── views.py
```

### Example Blueprint

```py
# blueprint.py

from duck.routes import Blueprint
from duck.urls import re_path, path
from . import views  

ProductsBlueprint = Blueprint(
    location=__file__,
    name="products",
    urlpatterns=[
        path(
            f"/list-products",
            views.product_list_view,
            name="list-products",
            methods=["GET"],
        ),
    ],
    prepend_name_to_urls=False,
    is_builtin=True,
    enable_template_dir=True,
    enable_static_dir=True,
)

```

```py
# settings.py

BLUEPRINTS = [  
    "some_name.blueprint.ProductsBlueprint",  
]
```

## Duck CLI

The **Duck CLI** provides a powerful command-line interface for managing and interacting with your **Duck** web server and framework. It is designed for ease of use, allowing you to perform various tasks with simple commands.

To get started, just type `duck` in your terminal to view available commands and their usage. The **Duck CLI** is powered by **Click**, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for developers of all levels.

With **Duck CLI**, you can streamline your workflow, automate tasks, and quickly manage configurations, making your development process more efficient and effective.


## 🔒 HTTPS and SSL Guide
Duck provides **built-in SSL configuration** with default server certificates and private keys for **development and testing** purposes.

**Additionally, you'll need to have OpenSSL installed on your system for SSL certificate generation**.

### ✅ Enabling HTTPS  
To activate HTTPS, set the following in your `settings.py`:  
```python
ENABLE_HTTPS = True
```

### 🔄 Force HTTPS Redirection  
To automatically redirect **all HTTP traffic to HTTPS**, enable the redirect feature:  
```python
FORCE_HTTPS = True
```

⚠️ **Note:** FORCE_HTTPS requires ENABLE_HTTPS to be set to True.

---

## 🚀 SSL Certificate Generation  
Duck includes an **`ssl-gen`** command to generate SSL certificates.

### 📌 Requirements  
Ensure you have **OpenSSL** installed before running the command.


## 🛠️ Production Recommendations

Use port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS in production.

**Secure your SSL configuration for enhanced security.**


## Duck Automations ⚙️

Duck offers powerful automation capabilities that can run tasks throughout your application's lifecycle. With Duck automations, you can schedule tasks to run when specific triggers occur, or you can set them up to run automatically at specified times. 

These automations are incredibly useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Automatically generating SSL certificates 🔒
- Handling routine maintenance tasks 🛠️
- Managing scheduled backups ⏳
- Triggering notifications or other actions based on specific events 📲

By leveraging Duck's automation framework, you can save time, reduce manual intervention, and ensure critical tasks are handled efficiently and reliably.


## Templates

Duck uses **Jinja2** as the default templating engine, but you can also use **Django templates** if preferred. Additionally, you can create custom template tags and filters within Duck, which will be available for use in both Jinja2 and Django templates.

**Note**:
- To use Duck’s custom tags or filters in a Django-rendered template, include the following at the top of the template:
  ```django
  {% load ducktags %}
  ```


## HTML Components to Use in Templates

Duck provides several HTML components that can be dynamically created and rendered in your templates. These components can be used in both **Jinja2** and **Django** templates.

## Usage Examples

### Jinja2 Template

You can use the HTML components like so in a Jinja2 template:

```jinja2
{{ Button(
    style={
        "background-color": "red",
        "color": "white",
    },
    properties={
        "value": "Hello world",
        "id": "btn"
    },
) }}
```

### Django Template

In Django templates, the usage is slightly different, and you need to ensure that the tag is on one line and keyword arguments are quoted as strings:
	
```django
{% Button %}
     properties={
         "id": "btn",
         "value": "Hello world"
      },
      style={
           "background-color": "blue",
            "color": "white"
       },
       optional_argument="Some value"
{% endButton %}
```

## HTML Components Configuration

### Enable HTML Components

By default, HTML components are enabled. You can configure whether to enable or disable the HTML components by setting the ENABLE_HTML_COMPONENTS variable in your settings:
```py
# settings.py

ENABLE_HTML_COMPONENTS: bool = True
```


### Available HTML Components

Duck comes with several pre-defined HTML components that you can use in your templates. These components are mapped to their corresponding classes.

```py
# settings.py

HTML_COMPONENTS: dict[str, str] = {
    "Button": "duck.html.components.button.Button",
    "FlatButton": "duck.html.components.button.FlatButton",
    "RaisedButton": "duck.html.components.button.RaisedButton",
    "Input": "duck.html.components.input.Input",
    "CSRFInput": "duck.html.components.input.CSRFInput",
    "Checkbox": "duck.html.components.checkbox.Checkbox",
    "Select": "duck.html.components.select.Select",
    "TextArea": "duck.html.components.textarea.TextArea",
}
```


## Creating Custom HTML Components

If you want to create your own HTML components, you can subclass one of Duck's base component classes: InnerHtmlComponent or NoInnerHtmlComponent.

### Example: Creating a Custom Button Component
```py
from duck.html.components import InnerHtmlComponent

class CustomButton(InnerHtmlComponent):
    """
    CustomHTML Button component.
    """
    def __init__(self, properties: dict[str, str] = {}, style: dict[str, str] = {}):
        """
        Initialize the Button component with optional properties and style.
        """
        btn_style = {
            "padding": "10px 20px",
            "cursor": "pointer",
            "transition": "background-color 0.3s ease",
            "border": "none",
        }  # Default style

        btn_style.update(style) if style else None  # Update default style with custom styles

        super().__init__("button", properties, btn_style)
```

**InnerHtmlComponent:** This is used when your HTML component has inner content, like a button or a div. You can define the content and the styles inside this component.

**NoInnerHtmlComponent:** This is used for self-closing tags, like inputs or checkboxes, where there’s no inner HTML content.


### How the Classes Work

**InnerHtmlComponent:** This is used for components that contain inner HTML (e.g., buttons, divs).  

**NoInnerHtmlComponent:** This is used for components that do not contain inner HTML (e.g., input fields, checkboxes).

---

This setup makes it easy to add reusable HTML components to your templates and customize their appearance and behavior by simply passing properties and styles. You can also extend this by creating custom components to suit your needs.


## React Integration
![React dark image](./images/react-dark.png)
Duck provides built-in **React integration**, allowing you to easily render React components and JSX code within your templates.
The default React configuration is pre-enabled, so you can get started quickly without any extra setup.


### Default Configuration
The default React configuration in Duck is as follows:

```py
FRONTEND: dict[str, dict] = {
    "REACT": {
        # URLs or file paths for loading React, ReactDOM, and Babel scripts (JavaScript only).
        # **Note**: The Babel script is required for JSX to JavaScript compilation.
        "scripts": [
            # React development script from UNPKG CDN
            "https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js",
            
            # ReactDOM development script from UNPKG CDN
            "https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js",
            
            # Babel standalone script for JSX transformation in the browser
            "https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"
        ],

        # The root URL for serving the React application.
        # This URL will serve the JSX code inside the "react_frontend" template tag.
        "root_url": "/react/serve",

        # URL for serving the React-related scripts.
        # The final route for the scripts will be a combination of root_url and scripts_url.
        "scripts_url": "/scripts",
    }
}
```

### Example Use Case
```html
<body id="root">
{% react_frontend %}

// React code goes here
  const App = () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to your first React app!</p>
      </div>
    );
  };

  // Rendering the React app into the #root element
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

{% endreact_frontend %}
</body>
```

### Customization
The default React configuration can be customized based on your project's needs.
You are free to modify the settings (e.g., changing script URLs, adjusting the root URL) to suit your preferences.


### Setting Up React
To ensure smooth integration of React with Duck, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd yourproject
duck collectscripts
```

### Security
Duck ensures the security of your React files and code when serving them, safeguarding your app while providing seamless React integration.


## Use React within your template using the following template tag:

```django
{% react_frontend %}
    Your JSX Code here
{% endreact_frontend %}
```

## Troubleshooting Tips:

### SSL Certificate Issues:
If SSL certificates are not being generated, ensure that OpenSSL is installed correctly on your machine. You can verify OpenSSL with:

```sh
openssl version
```

Also, check the permissions of the etc/ssl directory to ensure the webserver can write the certificates.

### Port Conflicts:
If the server fails to start due to a port conflict, check if the port is already in use by another service. You can specify an alternative port by passing the -p <port> argument:

```sh
python3 -m duck runserver -p 8080
```

### Django Disallowed Host Error

If you encounter the following error when running the Duck application:
```py
Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'sq7441iv4yyg1iczep3meyga1lbhpu.gkr.pxyecarnhz.com'. You may need to add 'sq7441iv4yyg1iczep3meyga1lbhpu.gkr.pxyecarnhz.com' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

This typically indicates that another instance of Django launched by Duck is already running. This instance may be configured to allow only specific hosts. To resolve the issue, you need to stop the old Django process before starting the new instance.

### Example:

To stop the old Django process, you can use the following steps:

1. List the running processes:

    ```
    $ ps
      PID TTY          TIME CMD
    4491 pts/0    00:00:00 /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
    21276 pts/0    00:00:02 python
    21285 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
    ```

2. Kill the old Django process (assuming the PID is 21276):

    ```
    kill 21276
    ```

Once the old process is stopped, you can continue with your new Django instance.


## Is it Worth Moving from Django Only to Duck? 🤔

The short answer is **Yes**! If you already have a Django application running, making the transition to Duck is straightforward. You don’t need to completely migrate your Django project—just configure a few settings, and you’ll be able to seamlessly integrate Duck into your existing setup.

You can continue using your existing Django project without starting from scratch. Duck enhances your current infrastructure, giving you more flexibility and control over certain processes while maintaining the stability of your Django application.

So, it’s not about migrating from Django; rather, it’s about extending and improving what you already have with the power of Duck! 🚀
